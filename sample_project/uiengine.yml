# Project config: Defaults to name and version from package.json.
# Here you can overwrite it and add more custom properties.
name: UIengine Sample Project
version: '1.0.0'

# Base directories for the input, your raw source files:
# - components is the root of the directory containing the components
# - templates contains the variation preview and sandbox templates
# - pages is the directory of the UIengine's site structure and page markdown files
source:
  components: ./src/components
  templates: ./src/templates
  pages: ./src/pages

# Destination paths for the generated output:
# - site is the directory where the html files for the pages will be stored
# - assets will contain the static files belonging to the theme (the sites UI)
target:
  site: ./dist
  assets: ./dist/assets

# If you want to use your own theme instead of the default one, there are two options:
# - provide the path to a directory inside this project that contains the theme
#   (case: you use the theme just for this project)
# - give the name of the npm package that is the theme
#   (case: you use the theme more than once and want to share it across projects)
#
# UIengine will `require` the theme, which has to provide a defined set of functions
# for setup and rendering. For details see the theme docs.
# theme: ./my-uiengine-theme

# Template adapters works similar to how configuring the theme is handled:
# - provide the path to a node module inside this project that configures your templating
#   (case: you use the templating just for this project)
# - give the name of the npm package that is the templating adapter
#   (case: you use the templating more than once and want to share it across projects)
#
# UIengine will `require` the template adapter, which has to provide a defined set of
# functions for setup and rendering. For details see the templating docs.
