# If you want to use your own theme instead of the default one, there are two options:
# - provide the path to a directory inside this project that contains the theme
#   (case: you use the theme just for this project)
# - give the name of the npm package that is the theme
#   (case: you use the theme more than once and want to share it across projects)
#
# UIengine will `require` the theme, which has to provide a defined set of functions for
# setup and rendering. For details see the theme docs in the README.
theme: ./theme
