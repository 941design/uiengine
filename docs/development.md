## Notes

Here are some things to keep in mind and guidelines for working on the UIengine codebase.

### Coding standards

This project uses the [JavaScript Standard Style](http://standardjs.com/).
We try to keep it as functional as possible, so we are using [Ramda](http://ramdajs.com/) a lot.

### Public functions

- Are always `async`
- First argument should always be the `state`
